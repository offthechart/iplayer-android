# OTC iPlayer for Android
Radio station client application for Android

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository is rather old and is unlikely to work out of the box. It is also highly likely that it suffers from security vulnerabilities.

## Background
This Android app provided a basic means to tune into the online radio station and to interact with the on air DJ. Requires libbass.so, libbass_aac.so, BASS.java and BASS_AAC.java from un4seen.

## Questions?
Feel free to create an issue. It's an awfully long time since I maintained this code however, so I can't guarantee I can remember how it works!
